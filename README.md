# Valerii Safronov - Junior Unreal Engine Generalist

### Professional Profile
I'm an Unreal Engine 4/5 developer. I became interested in games at the age of 13 and later started learning to program on Cryengine 5 at the age of 16, but eventually switched to Unreal Engine 4. I study at the university (SUT) on an individual basis and also actively maintain a YouTube channel, share development experience and progress, create tutorials, teach courses at my university for those who want to learn how to work in UE 4/5. Therefore, I can provide services for the development of game parts, but I would like to join a team of professionals who are also passionate about games, learn new things, share experiences and make the world of games even brighter. Therefore, I continue to improve my skills with Unreal Engine 4/5, Blender and C++ by taking courses.
